    This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you've learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis, on real-world tasks, using real-world tools and workflows.
    
    In this gentle introduction to DataCamp projects, we will walk you through the projects interface and you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.
